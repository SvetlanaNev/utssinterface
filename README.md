# UTS Startup Interface

A modern web interface for UTS startups to manage their team information through Airtable integration.

## Features

- **Email-based Access**: Secure login using email addresses registered in Airtable
- **Unique Link Generation**: Creates JWT-based magic links stored in Airtable
- **Startup Dashboard**: Displays company information and team member details
- **Profile Updates**: Team members can update their personal information
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Airtable (via API)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradient design

## Setup Instructions

### For Replit Deployment

   - Create a new Repl on Replit
   - Import this repository or copy all files

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - The `.env` file is already configured with your credentials
   - Make sure all environment variables are set correctly

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Click "Open in new tab" in Replit
   - Or use the URL provided by Replit

### For Local Development

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd uts-startup-interface
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Update `.env` file with your credentials

4. **Run in Development Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. Email Lookup Process
- User enters their email address on the home page
- System searches the "Team members" table in Airtable
- If found, retrieves associated startup information
- Generates a unique JWT token with 7-day expiry
- Updates the startup record with the magic link

### 2. Dashboard Access
- User accesses the unique link
- JWT token is verified and decoded
- Startup and team member data is fetched from Airtable
- Dynamic dashboard is generated and displayed

### 3. Profile Updates
- Users can update their profile information
- Changes are saved directly to Airtable
- Real-time validation and success feedback

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Landing page with email form
- `POST /lookup-email` - Email validation and link generation
- `GET /dashboard/:token` - Dashboard with startup info
- `POST /update-profile` - Update team member profile
